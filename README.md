# GitHub pages

Here are some static websites I made, some better than others. All of these can be viewed on my [GitHub page](mattigoofy.github.io). 

All projects are built with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Some projects use Firebase for database and user management. The password management is **not secure**, so please don't use your default password.

## Doomsday trainer

This is a website where you can train your knowledge of the Doomsday Algorithm. With this algorithm, you can calculate the weekday of a given date. You can learn more on the topic in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2x3SSBVGJU&t=228s).

## Encrypt

A small test website to get access to the members page of 'www.ceciliasteenbrugge.be/'. This is no longer used.

## Bookshelf

This provides a digital bookshelf where you can keep track of what you have read, watched or played. This is the first version.

## Bookshelf 2.0

The second versions tries a new approach. It is less developed, however. The login also doesn't seem to work anymore.

## Star wars speeder

A fun little game where you control a spaceship from the star wars universe and need to avoid hitting rocks.

## Taipan

This site can keep track of the score while playing the card game Taipan (or Tichu). Just fill in the teams and add points for each round. This can also be downloaded as an APK.

## Pinguins

A very simple site to learn the names of the penguins from Sealife.
